# Real-Time Article and Comment App

This project is a full-stack application that allows users to register, log in, and comment on articles in real-time using Socket.IO. The backend is built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, while the frontend is built with React and Tailwind CSS.

# Weak Points

- Server variables should not be exposed! Although on FE doesn't mean much, it's nice to have them as variables in one place.
- The layout is pretty poor, but I tried to make it more appealable and acceptable by using Tailwind
